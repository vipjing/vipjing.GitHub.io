## User Content

All concepts, ideas, comments, manuscripts, illustrations, and all other materials disclosed or offered to PingCAP on or in connection with the Site are submitted without any restrictions or expectation of confidentiality. PingCAP shall have no financial or other obligations to you when you submit such information, nor shall you assert any proprietary or moral right of any kind with respect to such submissions. PingCAP shall have the unrestricted right to use, publish, reproduce, transmit, download, upload, post, display, incorporate it (in whole or in part) in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, or otherwise distribute your submissions in any manner without notice or compensation to you.

You acknowledge that PingCAP reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all Information transmitted or received through the Site. PingCAP, at its sole discretion and without further notice to you, may (but is not obligated to) review, censor or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any Information which PingCAP deems inappropriate or that violates any term or condition of this agreement. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used for authorized purposes. Use of the Site, authorized or unauthorized, constitutes consent to such monitoring.

You may not link, upload, post or transmit any illegal, obscene, offensive or otherwise inappropriate material to the Site. Furthermore, you may not use any of PingCAP’s proprietary logos, marks, or other distinctive graphics, video, or audio material in your links, without PingCAP’s express written permission, which PingCAP may withhold in its sole discretion. You may not link in any manner reasonably likely to (i) imply affiliation with or endorsement or sponsorship by PingCAP; (ii) cause confusion, mistake, or deception; (iii) dilute PingCAP’s trademarks or service marks; or (iv) otherwise violate state or federal law.

## Arbitration

Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, any dispute or claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Terms of Service or the Site shall be finally resolved by arbitration.  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (“CPR”) Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the parties.  The arbitration shall take place in California or such other location as agreed to by the parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts having jurisdiction in the location where the arbitration is conducted as to judicial proceedings relating to any aspect of the arbitration, including motions to confirm, vacate, modify or correct an arbitration award.  The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets.  The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator, who shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement within 30 days after the initiation of the arbitration, by the CPR.  The parties shall be responsible for paying the costs of the arbitration in accordance with CPR rules.  The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it shall not be disclosed beyond the tribunal, the parties and their counsel, and any person necessary to the conduct of the proceeding.  The confidentiality obligations shall not apply if disclosure is required by law or in judicial or administrative proceedings, or to the extent that disclosure is necessary to enforce the rights arising out of the award, provided that the parties agree to use best efforts to keep such disclosure confidential and agree, subject to court approval, to submit such disclosure to a court only under seal.  Claims may not be brought in the arbitration proceeding by or on behalf of a purported class of claimants who are not parties to this engagement letter.  This agreement to arbitrate shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of each party’s right to a trial by jury, as well as of rights to discovery or to an appeal that would customarily be available in a judicial proceeding but that may be limited or unavailable in connection with such an arbitration.

To the extent that this arbitration requirement is found to be entirely unenforceable, you agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Terms of Service or the Site will be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction, federal or state, located within California, and in no other jurisdiction, and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, such court.

## Other

This Terms of Service is the entire agreement between you and PingCAP with respect to, and supersedes any previous oral or written communications or documents concerning, the subject matter of this Terms of Service.  In no event will any additional or inconsistent term in any purchase order or similar document submitted by you modify the terms of this Terms of Service.

If any provision of this Terms of Service is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the extent permissible and, to the extent invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed modified to the most limited extent necessary to be valid and enforceable, in accordance with applicable law, while still as fully as possible carrying out the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of this Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.

Failure by PingCAP to prosecute any right with respect to a default hereunder will not constitute a waiver by PingCAP of the right to enforce rights with respect to the same or any other breach.
